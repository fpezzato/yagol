# yagol - Yet Another Game of Life

#### TL;DR:
This is a _tiny_ experiment arount Android development. 
Involved in this repo:
- MVP architecture
- Custom View
- Android Design library (CoordinatorLayout and AppBarLayout)
- JUnit4 / Robolectric3 / Mockito
- RxJava

----
The main purpose purpose of this repo is to put in practise some Android dev techniques and libraries useful to develop apps.
Moreover I took a chance to implement the [Conway's_Game_of_Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).

The algorithm itself is not optimized (as it wasn't really my target), check [conwaylife.com](http://www.conwaylife.com/) for ultra-fast implementations.
